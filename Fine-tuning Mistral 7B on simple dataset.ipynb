But what amused my father and my husband the most, who were with me that day, was that for the proof of address, the salesman tried to teach me what a property and housing tax was for by looking down on me even though I am a notary. Everywhere else, the council tax is accepted as proof of address, but Renault Automobile does not! I clearly think that he is confusing property tax, vacant housing tax and housing tax. The last straw to be able to do the paperwork for the vehicle. I finally had to produce an invoice at the dealership for my second home and not for my main residence which was accepted and therefore made the change of address myself on the registration document with my housing tax which had been refused. Secondly, I find it shameful that it is not possible to get a quote for the service of my vehicle, by making a request by email or by phone. While this is possible, by making the request at Midas or Speedy. It is absolutely necessary to go to them to get this quote.

Following a simple damage by rear impact on my car in February, I had to hand over my car 5 or 6 times because each time it was returned to me with unchanged parts while I indicated the parts to be changed, in accordance with the expertise! Each time with a delay of several weeks. The opening hours are absolutely not adapted to the people who work, and when it comes to dropping off the car once you can arrange it, but after a certain number of times it becomes very restrictive. I pass the many inconveniences. Last time, only a reflector had to be changed: 2 weeks delay for an umpteenth appointment, taken care of on Monday, I was asked to pick it up on Friday. That very day, I called to let them know that it would be my spouse who would pick up the car. Half an hour before closing time, my father was called back (why? Number found on the insurance contract) to tell me that the car is not ready and that I will have to pick it up on Tuesday. My spouse had already left on his bike (1 hour) and had to make the return trip (1 hour). There is no seriousness and no consideration of people in my opinion. Doesn't even do the union minimum.

That was not possible, they wanted to install a completely new headlamp. While every year my lights were adjusted like this before going to the inspection. First I had to sign a receipt that it was 0 euros. For adjustment. Then they told me that it could not be adjusted, then suddenly I had to pay 11 € for the advice. Literally watched it for 2 minutes. And when I dared to say something about this.. the most arrogant knai came forward to ask me if I work for free. Yes, I do favor regular customers from time to time and I expect my regular garage to do the same for regular customers. Especially if you only watch for 2 minutes and do nothing... . Just downright outrageous. They will never see me here again. and I hope people read my review and think... That is indeed not the garage I would like to become a regular customer of. Edit: Easy that you agree like this. I have been coming to your garage for maintenance for 2 years.. Isn't that a regular customer? And you don't react to the fact that you first have me sign a 0 euro receipt. And then then suddenly pay 11€ for the same thing. You can try to fall back on your so-called terms, I didn't ask for advice. I asked for my lights to be adjusted. It's not even about the tenner I have to pay. I'm concerned about the terrible service you provide and on top of that also unfriendly. Do you know what the problem is? You saw from our reaction to the expensive repair of 330 euros for a headlight, that we were going to do this ourselves and then you thought, we are going to make them pay nicely then we have earned something from it. Now you will never earn another euro from me and if someone asks me where they should go for their car.. I will certainly say not at Bilzen motors.\\n\\n### Response:\\nNegative</s>\", \"<s>[INST]### Instruction:\\nUse the provided input to write a response that represent the polarity of the text.

Either Positive, Negative or Neutral.[/INST]\\n\\n### Input:\\nBad experience! I've just been doing a review, and I can say that I didn't like it at all. The value of the standard service is very high and they simply do almost nothing to the vehicle, pay almost a thousand reais to change filter and oil practically. I also add that I did all the annual revisions of my vehicle until then at the Renault Pampulha dealership and at no time in the 10km revision did they inform me that the peneus should be relayed and look that I even paid for the alignment and balancing, then in this year's revision the attendant said that the tires should have been rotated,  But on no other visit to the dealership was this informed to me. Conclusion, a thousand reais paid for having simply done nothing, it is not possible that the tire rotation is not included in this standard review, which is very expensive for the services provided. In addition, the attendant didn't even bother to contact me when I had completed the service, as it was already 2 hours after I left the car at the dealership, I decided to go see why the delay, since they didn't contact me at any time, when we got there the car was already ready and who knows how long ago.\\n\\n### Response:\\nNegative</s>\", '<s>[INST]### Instruction:\\nUse the provided input to write a response that represent the polarity of the text.

He decides to contact the Renault where the vehicle is deposited to unblock the situation. Following his call, I learn that my vehicle is ready within 2 days. Balance an EGR valve and DIAC support.

They told me that the tie rod had been replaced and that everything was fine now. Unfortunately, the defect in the closure had even worsened. I went back a third time, left the car again for several hours. They assured me that the tie rod had been adjusted and now everything was fine. Unfortunately, nothing has changed: the hatch continues to close with difficulty and without adequate thrust it remains ajar. Now I ask myself: is it simply a matter of incapacity on the part of the staff or of total indifference to the customers who, having the guarantee, do not have to pay for the work?

Very good information when in the revision of the car the need to change the engine battery arose. Very good waiting time and delivery of the car, clean as well I have been to Dacia Autosae Aranjuez again to change the brake pads. As always, it was easy to make an appointment and have it fit my schedule needs. Punctual car reception. The unbeatable attention, both waiting in the living room, and picking up the car, informing of the work done. Actually, a necessary and at first uncomfortable activity such as taking the car for service or changing a part, at Auto Sae Aranjuez is easy and even pleasant. I drive the car, they receive me with great cordiality, they take it to the workshop. I take my booklet that I have taken with me to read there. I pull a latte out of the machine and sit down in the waiting room. The workers and customers who pass by say good morning to you. They let you know when it's ready and, with the same cordiality with which they received you, they explain what they've done and if there's anything else you need to know. Very nice Auto Sae Aranjuez, to be honest, very nice and impeccable work, I have never had any problems because of it.

The manual is the spare key were delivered in a plastic bag, even customized, with mt poor quality. As bad as is the print quality and quality of the paper used in the manual. Bad! Even if Renault has this flaw, Leauto could put these items in a more presentable wallet. Does the car come out with a Leauto sticker, but can't afford to offer a better packaging presentation for the items mentioned? Another critical point is the amount of fuel in the tank. A car worth R$ 133,000.00 and there wasn't even enough fuel to do the vehicle presentation tests? The demonstration of the vehicle was interrupted for fear of running out of fuel! Such a shame! The highlight was the salesman Ryan. Excellent! Super attentive, answered all our questions and was very attentive.

After payment, I reported my problem to the internal quality service of DACIA BARI but even here they put me waiting for info that does not arrive. UPDATE: Immediately after the publication of this review I was contacted by the Marino Group by phone. Unfortunately, after a cordial discussion, I remain on my idea of having received a very bad treatment both communicatively (as my phone calls have fallen into oblivion) and economically. The quote I printed from the site is about 80 euros lower than the price I actually paid. To add insult to injury, the Marino group did NOT accept (it is within its right) the promotional offers that were proposed to me by DACIA Italy and which would have made the cost of the service even lower.\\n\\n### Response:\\nNegative</s>', '<s>[INST]### Instruction:\\nUse the provided input to write a response that represent the polarity of the text.

As soon as you leave the dealership, the gas tank is on reserve (even if I know that the tank is not filled, we always hope to have a little more). After 10 km a warning light comes on and the message: \"inflate tyre and init\". I go back to the dealership who directs me to Renault minute who checks the pressure and tells me that the 2 rear tires are not inflated enough. I am surprised because 30 minutes before the person who delivered the car made me sign and give me a document with all the checks carried out before the delivery (including obviously the tire pressure), I sincerely hope that all the other checkpoints were done more seriously. On October 20th, I contacted the dealership because I still hadn\\'t received my registration document. I\\'m told she should arrive the following week and to contact them if I don\\'t have anything. This day 27/10/2027 i.e. 1 month after the delivery, still not having my registration document I contact them to have news, and then I am told that the registration request had not been made on their part. I am charged 250€ for the registration process, but no action is taken. Today I don\\'t have a registration certificate (carte grise), my CPI (provisional registration certificate is no longer valid: valid for 1 month). So I can\\'t drive my car anymore. For its lack of professionalism I do not recommend Renault Aubagne\\n\\n### Response:\\nNegative</s>', '<s>[INST]### Instruction:\\nUse the provided input to write a response that represent the polarity of the text.

Either Positive, Negative or Neutral.[/INST]\\n\\n### Input:\\nI brought my car to ABD Renault in Dokkum a while ago. I heard a rattle at the engine and immediately thought wrong. That\\'s why I immediately called and could come by immediately, great. The very friendly mechanic immediately mentioned to me that he would no longer let me drive my car home because of the ratchet. So I was also offered a loan car by the seller at the counter (name known) which I was of course happy with because I can\\'t do without a car. Due to crowds, they could only work on my car a week later, which I understood and also thought it was neat that I did not get any extra costs with the loan car. Two weeks later I see my car moving in Drachten (ABD Nissan), the first test drive, I have an Apple AirTag in the car so I can see if that moved. In the evening I see my car in Broeksterwâld in a residential area I personally found very strange. Next day I see that it goes to ABD Dokkum and stands still there. Then another test ride of about half an hour is done, why? Eventually I was allowed to pick up my car. I cleaned and sucked out my car with a full tank. To my great surprise, I got a dirty car back. But it gets even more fun, because I found ash on my dashboard and tobacco grit on the floor. I didn\\'t smoke in my car and certainly never did, but according to ABD that wasn\\'t theirs. I also asked why my car was in a residential area, to which the reaction was: \"then the chief mechanic took it for extra check\" sounds logical to me at first. But the salesman I mentioned above who was sitting at the counter (name known) who smokes and was also smart enough to put his phone in my car and not delete it. And also nice to see that more than half the tank had been emptied. And you would do a big turn and MOT, but the MOT was never carried out and it will expire soon. I think it\\'s neat that the chain was still covered by the BOVAG warranty, because it had expired two weeks earlier, but I will never come to ABD again.\\n\\n### Response:\\nNegative</s>', '<s>[INST]### Instruction:\\nUse the provided input to write a response that represent the polarity of the text.

It was just a misconnected pipe. I was happy to get my car back but not for long as I still have the same indication on the dashboard and smoke everywhere. The end of the story is that I went to Renault with a car that was running well, I pay for a diagnosis and repairs to finally leave with a car that can no longer drive. I hope to be called back by the mechanic to find a solution.

The problem arises when you start using and servicing the car. At 38,000km, an unpleasant creak from the front axle began to be heard. This was removed under warranty (one side of the shock absorber mountings replaced). After 11 months and less than 12,000km, the defect appeared again, with the fact that they demand € 760 for removal. And not one side was for exchange, but both. Yes, even that page repaired 11 months ago needs correction again. According to the \"system\", the warranty can no longer be applied, even though the car is still under extended warranty (47 months out of a total of 60 have passed). So I have a car with 50,000km that creaks like a 20-year-old fabia at 200,000km. And I have Megane. Megane, which requires a €700 repair every 12,000km, otherwise creaks like an old wreck. The last Renault car I bought in my life. Never again. If you want a new car that after just a few months will start to behave like an old wreck, then cheerfully go for it. Otherwise, I recommend that you change your mind.

Today is Oct 24, 2023 I notice while reading comments that my problem is not isolated. Garage to leak. Pb on vehicle in March. After many twists and turns (vehicle supposedly \"repaired\" several times while the exact same breakdown reappeared a few hours later), the vehicle was returned to us in April, with the indication: we do not advise you to drive on the highway, the breakdown can reappear. The exact same failure happened again a few days later. Unusable car \"Funny\" after paying 1500 €. It turns out that the first quotes/repairs hadn\\'t seen the real pb... which cannot be repaired because the necessary enclosure is no longer manufactured. To sum up, we paid 1500€ for a fault that was not repaired, because the first diagnoses were wrong. Joke 2: The garage refuses to reimburse the costs incurred!! However, I would like to remind you that under Article 1231-1 of the Civil Code, he was required to carry out an accurate and complete diagnosis of the repairs to be carried out, which was not done in March.... I went to this garage with my eyes closed because he had already intervened on my vehicle for the control of the 20000. Qd everything is simple, he gets by.

We let them know and they tell us that nothing is wrong and they give us an appointment to see it a week. They lend us a duster and a week later they make us return it and give us a Clio with insurance with excess, alluding that they can't give us another one because they have to change a piece of which there is no stock and they don't know when it will arrive. We are a large family with a 2 month old baby. Our car is paying for comprehensive insurance and is this your solution? The car paid in full. I repeat that it is a disastrous management. In addition, now the car cannot be used for safety reasons until they change the part and before that? Why did they allow the car to be registered like this? How can there be no stock of the part being new and not give us a deadline? And the best part is that the warranty period will continue to run...

Either Positive, Negative or Neutral.[/INST]\\n\\n### Input:\\nOn October 10, 2023 I went to their Dealer at 10:00 am, by appointment, to have a bed cabinet installed in the Dacia Jogger that I bought at that Dealership. Over the phone I was told that it would take about 3 hours to install it. At 12:45 I went and they told me that they didn't have it, that they would let me know by phone as we had agreed. At 15:02 I called them when they didn't contact me and they told me that they already had it and that I could pick it up. The truth is that if the furniture has to be assembled beforehand, it would be good if it was ready because placing it in the car takes 5 minutes. A server comes from Borja (Zaragoza) which is where I live. When they delivered the car with the bed assembled, they explained to me how it was deployed, but they forgot to tell me that they had to move laterally some widenings to place the mattress on top of the bed base. I had seen it on the Internet. They told me that the mattress would be rolled out and that was it. I would have liked them to have extended me right there, but I understood that maybe they didn't want to take it out of its plastic case and I didn't think anything of it. As soon as I left the dealership, I parked to see the furniture in detail and consult the manual they provided me. I noticed that they had only placed two straps of kas four that I had to carry to the anchors. I went back again and explained what I had observed and was told that although in the manual it said that I was wearing 4 straps, I was only wearing 2. I told them that the back straps were on the furniture but that they had not been placed in the corresponding anchors. They put them up and apologized to me. I also told them that while I was looking at the furniture I saw that the upper rubbers of the rear windows were breaking. They took notes, took pictures and told me not to worry that it was under warranty and that when the parts arrived they would let me know to change them but that it would take a while to receive it. No problem. The treatment was friendly. I take this opportunity to tell you that when I arrived at my house, while observing the deteriorated tires, mentioned above, I realized that with the rear windows partially open they could move laterally. My logic tells me that it shouldn't be so, but I don't know. Finally, I want to tell you that when I bought the car at your dealership I said that as soon as the marketing of the bed furniture reached them, they should let me know because I had bought this car because of the possibility of this functionality. When I was notified, I was told that the price was approximately €1,800. I told them that on the Internet I had seen that in Spain it was sold at €1,500 if it was purchased with the purchase of the vehicle. They told me that they would call me to consult it beforehand and finally they made me the offer of €1,620 claiming that that was the cost price, to which I agreed. Apologies if I've been wordy in my exposition but ask that the more details of my experience the better. Attn.

At first, I was a bit skeptical about the topic of e-mobility, but in connection with photovoltaics it gets interesting. Mrs. Maathuis welcomed us and we easily arranged a test drive. Cool car, perfectly sufficient for a daily distance of about 80 km and attractive in price. Then came the questions: What suits us better, leasing/buying? Mrs. Maathuis took the time to go through everything with us until we could make a clear decision. Furthermore, we did not know whether the optional fast charging connection (+800€) would be necessary for the Spring. Based on the user profile we described, she advised us against it. It was the right decision! Money saved! You had a good feeling during the whole decision-making process, here you honestly looked at what was best for the customer and not talked about anything. In the end, we struck at Leemhuis. Many thanks again to Mrs Maathuis! Honest, very sympathetic and reliable service at fair conditions! I can fully recommend the dealership!

With his uncomplicated and technically adept manner, we found him very pleasant to deal with. At the beginning, we even turned down the initial offer because we were undecided about what we wanted. Jan didn't put us under any pressure here and wished us all the best. After further search and consideration, we agreed that the Dacia was the best decision for us and inquired again. The sale was completed to the delight of all parties involved. Of course, the handover was also great, including champagne and a detailed explanation of all controls and features.

I told about additional troubles: a poorly functioning refueling cap; additional sound when driving at ~95km/h when loading the engine; the pulsation and extinguishing of the engine when I drive about 1km to the store with a cold engine, extinguish it, and after ~10 minutes I light up again. I hoped that during such service not only the cabin filter would be replaced, but also engine oil, oils and air filters. I wasn't informed what was going to be done, but I wasn't interested either, but that's what I'm going to say is my own fault. Two and a half hours after leaving the car in the cabin, I was informed that the car was ready to be picked up, but the mechanic did not hear any sounds during the test drive, said that it was supposedly a sound from the tires. The test drive lasted half an hour and came at 32.12. Due to the problem of pulsing the engine, he said that the diagnostics did not show anything. I came to pick up the car, tried to explain to the manager what the problems were and if I could show the mechanic myself when that sound appears if it doesn't come out myself. As I continued to discuss possible solutions, I offered to show a video of what that engine pulsation from the driver's seat looks like, but I was told that they didn't need any video. Both during the check-in and upon arrival, I tried several times to explain when and how it was happening, but I was told that maybe I myself do not know when and how that problem arises. Among other things, when asked how often this happens, I answered each time under the stated conditions. The idea still pops up for me, if I'm already buying a new car, then it's already too much for me and one time. There is also an invoiced amount for maintenance (44.98), but no details were given about it. I opened the hood to see if anything had been done there, but the view was even more surprising. I saw a hose coming into the throttle, possibly damaged by some beast. It's the way it is, but was the mechanic at least the hood open, much less did he inspect the entire rest of the car? This is the question for me what is a car warranty worth and what is car service worth? I will have to waste time again, drive the car to the service again to correct the problems, only I wonder if I will again have to pay money for a test drive and diagnostics in search of problems.

The person who attended me told me not to worry that they had them there to fix the problem, but when they call me after 2 weeks with the car already fixed they tell me that they did not have cables because it was an old car (which I already assumed) nor did they have any in the workshop either. What I don't understand is that they assure a customer that they have something without even having checked it, but they assured me that the repair even though they had done welding due to the absence of wiring was good. Another thing that is repeated, and we go back to the same thing since they were full of work, is that they delivered the car to me just as dirty as the tow truck took it (if you are with a car and you want your client to be happy I think that having that detail of giving him a wash or at least a soak is not bad) since I cannot drive because I am operated,  And despite being an automatic car, if I do it I risk a penalty.

The repair takes 47 days, to change a front window, the hood and repair hail blows on the roof. Finally they have delivered the vehicle with a side indicator without replacing it being hit by hail, because the expert did not notice and was not in the appraisal.

He says there's a mistake and turns around. The part manager is probably generally losing motivation, because when he comes in and asks for help to order a part, he does not even lift his eyes and ignores it.

I bought my car with 16000km, so I am the second owner. As a new owner, I did all the revisions and maintenance within the authorized dealership, however, when a problem was detected in the seat belt, it was not covered because the 10000km service was not registered by the previous owner. The problem occurred after the official 20000km service, done by me at the dealership. I think Renault should have been responsible for this defect, which didn't happen... My car is within the three years and with less than 10000km. I currently have two Renault vehicles, however, with this Renault position, I am questioning my next vehicle change... I'm starting to question the safety of this brand...\\n\\n### Response:\\nPositive</s>\", '<s>[INST]### Instruction:\\nUse the provided input to write a response that represent the polarity of the text.

My vehicle (CLIO) delivered on 01/12/21 is incomplete and non-compliant (no automatically folding electric mirrors and inflation kit). However, the sales department had told me that they had anticipated the shortage of electronic components in order to deliver my vehicle quickly. White lie! Despite my repeated requests over the past year and a half to the customer relations department, the group management and the customer satisfaction department, I have not been able to obtain satisfaction. I have not been able to use this vehicle normally since it was delivered. Faced with the inefficiency of the salesman, I asked the customer relations department and Renault's sales department to cancel the sale, but there was no response. This disastrous experience contrasts with the flattering impression of my first contacts. This lack of professionalism and the non-compliance with the seller's obligations have already been mentioned several times about this manufacturer!

I have become really angry and still want to make a formal complaint about this. You've been on the phone several times and promised to fix this.
